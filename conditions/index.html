<section id="plantar-fasciitis" class="card">
  <h2>Plantar fasciitis and the morning hobble</h2>
  <p>Plantar fasciitis is the most common cause of stabbing heel pain, and Florida clinics see it year-round thanks to active lifestyles and hard surfaces. The plantar fascia is the strong band of tissue that runs from the heel bone to the toes. When tiny micro-tears form where it attaches to the heel, the body mounts an inflammatory response that is most noticeable with those first steps out of bed or after a long drive.</p>
  <p>Risk factors include sudden jumps in walking or running mileage, weight gain that increases load through the arch, tight calf muscles, or jobs that keep you on your feet without supportive footwear. A podiatrist will confirm the diagnosis with a hands-on exam, gait analysis, and occasionally ultrasound to rule out partial tears or Baxter’s nerve entrapment.</p>
  <h3>Relief goals your provider may discuss</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Structured stretching: calf stretches, plantar fascia massage, and night splints that hold the ankle at a gentle angle.</li>
    <li>Footwear upgrades: rocker-bottom shoes, removable insoles, or custom orthotics that redistribute heel pressure.</li>
    <li>Anti-inflammatory strategies: short courses of NSAIDs, icing, or focused shockwave therapy when conservative care stalls.</li>
    <li>Strengthening the kinetic chain: targeted exercises for the glutes and intrinsic foot muscles to improve mechanics.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Most patients recover within three to six months of layered conservative care. Persistent pain warrants imaging for stress fractures or a conversation about newer biologic injections, but surgery remains a rare last resort.</p>
</section>

<section id="bunions" class="card">
  <h2>Bunions and forefoot alignment</h2>
  <p>A bunion forms when the first metatarsal bone drifts inward and the big toe angles toward its neighbors, creating that characteristic bump at the base of the toe. Genetics set the stage, but footwear choices, hypermobile joints, and inflammatory conditions like rheumatoid arthritis can accelerate the deformity.</p>
  <p>Mild bunions often respond to simple changes: roomy toe boxes, soft gel spacers, and custom orthotics that realign the forefoot. A podiatrist will also assess for sesamoid irritation, hammertoes, and skin breakdown, conditions that change the treatment timeline.</p>
  <p>When pain limits daily activity or the big toe crosses over the second toe, surgery may be recommended. Modern minimally invasive bunion procedures can correct the bone alignment through tiny incisions, reduce scar tissue, and shorten recovery compared with older techniques. Your surgeon will tailor the procedure based on bone angles measured on weight-bearing X-rays and your lifestyle goals.</p>
</section>

<section id="achilles" class="card">
  <h2>Achilles tendon disorders</h2>
  <p>The Achilles tendon already endures forces up to eight times bodyweight with each push-off. Add in hill repeats, sudden changes in training, or walking barefoot on hard tile and you have the recipe for irritation. Achilles tendinopathy presents as burning, stiffness, or a palpable nodule 2–6 cm above the heel bone. Insertional tendinopathy, where the tendon meets the calcaneus, is common in patients with Haglund’s deformity or long-standing plantar fasciitis.</p>
  <p>Podiatrists segment treatment into load management and tendon remodeling. That often includes eccentric calf exercises performed on a step, heel lifts to temporarily reduce strain, and manual therapy to improve ankle mobility. Diagnostic ultrasound helps distinguish degenerative changes from partial tears, guiding whether platelet-rich plasma injections or extracorporeal shockwave might add value.</p>
  <p>Warning signs that demand urgent assessment include a sudden “pop,” difficulty pushing off, and a visible indentation in the tendon—hallmarks of rupture. Early surgical or functional bracing decisions make the difference between a smooth recovery and long-term weakness.</p>
</section>

<section id="heel-pain" class="card">
  <h2>Chronic heel pain beyond plantar fasciitis</h2>
  <p>Heel pain can stem from the fat pad, nerves, or the bone itself. Baxter’s nerve entrapment, for instance, produces burning along the inside of the heel and is frequently misdiagnosed. Heel pad syndrome feels like you are walking on a stone because the natural cushioning has thinned over time—a common scenario for patients who have spent decades on concrete floors.</p>
  <p>Stress fractures of the calcaneus may occur after a rapid increase in step counts, marching drills, or a new court sport. They present with diffuse aching and swelling that worsens with weight bearing. Imaging helps differentiate between stress injuries, fascia tears, and inflammatory arthropathies that can also attack the heel.</p>
  <p>A tailored plan might include off-loading inserts, taping techniques, short immobilization in a boot, or referral to a physical therapist for nerve gliding. Persistent heel pain deserves a second look; catching a stress fracture early prevents a more serious break later.</p>
</section>

<section id="ingrown-toenails" class="card">
  <h2>Ingrown and brittle toenails</h2>
  <p>Ingrown toenails develop when the nail plate curves into the surrounding skin. Tight shoes, improper trimming, trauma, and genetic nail shapes all contribute. Early symptoms include tenderness, swelling, and a shiny appearance along the nail edge. If bacteria enter, the area can become red, warm, and drain fluid.</p>
  <p>Podiatrists manage ingrown nails with in-office procedures that remove the offending nail border under local anaesthetic. A chemical matrixectomy can permanently prevent regrowth on the problem side. Keeping nails straight across, avoiding aggressive pedicures, and managing fungal infections reduce recurrence.</p>
  <p>Brittle or thickened nails often signal a fungal infection, psoriasis, or microtrauma from repetitive sports. A lab culture or pathology exam of a nail clipping helps target the correct treatment—topical antifungals, oral medication with liver monitoring, or laser therapy for resistant cases.</p>
</section>

<section id="diabetic-foot" class="card">
  <h2>Diabetic foot health and ulcer prevention</h2>
  <p>People living with diabetes face a dual challenge: peripheral neuropathy diminishes protective sensation while circulation problems slow healing. Together they create an environment where blisters, calluses, or cracked heels can evolve into ulcers in a matter of days. In Florida’s heat, moisture and friction from sandals or flip-flops add another layer of risk.</p>
  <p>A preventive visit includes monofilament testing for sensation, Doppler assessment of pulses, and shoe inspections. Your podiatrist may recommend diabetic footwear with seamless interiors, cushioned insoles, and custom inserts to redistribute pressure away from vulnerable areas.</p>
  <p>If an ulcer appears, prompt care is essential. Treatment typically blends debridement of non-viable tissue, moisture-balanced dressings, infection control, and off-loading with a removable boot or total contact cast. Advanced therapies—such as cellular grafts or negative pressure wound therapy—are used when ulcers stall. Aim for a multidisciplinary approach with endocrinology, vascular surgery, and wound care specialists to protect mobility.</p>
</section>

<section id="nerve-circulation" class="card">
  <h2>Nerve and circulation changes</h2>
  <p>Numbness, tingling, electric shocks, or a “sock bunched up” sensation often point to peripheral neuropathy. Causes range from diabetes and vitamin deficiencies to alcohol use or chemotherapy. Thorough lab work and medication reviews reveal reversible triggers.</p>
  <p>Separately, peripheral artery disease (PAD) reduces blood flow to the feet. Warning signs include calf cramping with walking, cold toes, slow-healing cuts, or shiny, hairless skin. A podiatrist may order ankle-brachial index testing or refer to a vascular specialist if pulses are diminished.</p>
  <p>Management involves addressing the root cause—optimising blood sugar, supplementing B vitamins, or adjusting medications—while protecting the feet. Daily self-checks, moisture control, and balance exercises help maintain safety. When neuropathic pain interferes with sleep, providers may prescribe topical compounded creams, gabapentin, or neuromodulation techniques.</p>
</section>

<section id="pediatric" class="card">
  <h2>Growing feet: kids and teens</h2>
  <p>Children’s feet change rapidly, and many concerns resolve naturally as muscles strengthen. Flat feet, for example, are normal through age six because the arch fat pad is still present. Intervention is required when a child experiences pain, tripping, or an asymmetrical gait.</p>
  <p>Other pediatric issues include Sever’s disease (heel pain from a growth plate flare), in-toeing, or flexible hammertoes. A podiatrist evaluates alignment, shoe wear, and participation in sports. Treatment may involve activity modification, stretching, supportive sneakers, or short periods in orthotics. More rigid deformities or limb-length discrepancies prompt referral to paediatric orthopaedics.</p>
  <p>Parents should seek care when limping persists, swelling appears without a clear injury, or the child withdraws from play. Early guidance prevents compensations that can lead to hip or knee discomfort later in life.</p>
</section>

<section id="sports-injuries" class="card">
  <h2>Sports and overuse injuries</h2>
  <p>Florida’s year-round training season is a gift—and a risk factor. Common athletic injuries include ankle sprains, stress fractures in the metatarsals, turf toe, and peroneal tendonitis from lateral sports like tennis or pickleball. Each injury presents differently: sprains cause swelling and instability, stress fractures create pinpoint tenderness, and turf toe leads to swelling at the big toe joint after a forceful bend.</p>
  <p>Podiatrists craft return-to-play plans that respect tissue healing times. They may order digital X-rays or MRI for elusive fractures, recommend bracing or taping, and partner with physical therapists for balance and proprioception drills. Footwear audits are crucial—many athletes discover their shoes are worn out long before they look flat.</p>
  <p>Do not rush back into training at full tilt. A staged progression with cross-training, ankle strengthening, and sport-specific drills helps prevent repeat injuries that can haunt a season.</p>
</section>

<section id="arthritis" class="card">
  <h2>Arthritis and joint degeneration</h2>
  <p>Osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, and post-traumatic arthritis can each settle into the small joints of the foot and ankle. Symptoms include morning stiffness, swelling around the joints, and a grating sensation with motion. Hallux rigidus—arthritis of the big toe joint—is notorious for making push-off painful, while ankle arthritis limits hiking, dancing, and even walking on uneven ground.</p>
  <p>Conservative care starts with anti-inflammatory medication, joint-friendly exercise, and devices that limit painful motion such as carbon-fibre plates or ankle-foot orthoses. Cortisone injections offer temporary relief for flares, while hyaluronic acid or platelet-rich plasma injections are gaining traction for select patients.</p>
  <p>When pain persists, surgical options include cheilectomy to smooth bone spurs, joint fusion for stability, or total ankle replacement in carefully selected candidates. Your podiatric surgeon will weigh bone quality, alignment, and activity level to recommend the safest path.</p>

  <h2>Partner with a podiatrist you trust</h2>
  <p>Educational guides are a launch pad, not a diagnosis. Track what aggravates or relieves your symptoms, snap photos of swelling or skin changes, and bring a list of medications to your appointment. Your podiatrist can then tailor imaging, orthotics, medications, or surgical planning to your goals—whether that means finishing a marathon, keeping up with grandkids, or simply walking the beach without pain. When you are ready for the next step, explore our <a href="/podoguide/podiatrists/">Florida podiatrist directory</a> to match with a specialist who aligns with your needs.</p>
